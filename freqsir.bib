abstract = {This workshop will introduce techniques for ﬁtting models to diﬀerent types of epidemiological data. Typically, we assume (that is, we pretend we know to be true) that the model takes a certain structure. In this module, we introduce some of the structures that are useful for modeling the temporal dynamics of disease transmission. This introduction serves several purposes. First, by looking at some speciﬁc models we will start the estimation part of the workshop with a shared conceptual baseline. Second, the models we look at here are fundamental and relatively general and therefore readily extended for your own purposes in the future. Third, we introduce some numerical tools that are useful for studying epidemiological systems. And, ﬁnally, by simulating these systems we produce some datasets in which the dynamical data-generating process is truly known. By trying out our estimation techniques on these known processes, we can study how well the various techniques perform under diﬀerent circumstances.},

abstract = {A brief introduction to the formulation of various types of stochastic epidemic models is presented based on the well-known deterministic SIS and SIR epidemic models. Three different types of stochastic model formulations are discussed: discrete time Markov chain, continuous time Markov chain and stochastic differential equations. Properties unique to the stochastic models are presented: probability of disease extinction, probability of disease outbreak, quasistationary probability distribution, final size distribution, and expected duration of an epidemic. The chapter ends with a discussion of two stochastic formulations that cannot be directly related to the SIS and SIR epidemic models. They are discrete time Markov chain formulations applied in the study of epidemics within households (chain binomial models) and in the prediction of the initial spread of an epidemic (branching processes).},
